# NCAA Game Predictions

This project aims to predict the outcomes of NCAA basketball games using machine learning models. The code leverages the `scikit-learn` library for building and evaluating the models, and the `cbbpy` library for scraping game data.

## High Confidence Predictions:
| Game Day       | Home Team            | Away Team           | Predicted Winner     |   Win Probability |
|:---------------|:---------------------|:--------------------|:---------------------|------------------:|
| March 22, 2025 | Auburn Tigers        | Creighton Bluejays  | Auburn Tigers        |              0.87 |
| March 22, 2025 | St. John's Red Storm | Arkansas Razorbacks | St. John's Red Storm |              0.86 |## Description

The main functionalities of this project include:

- Scraping NCAA basketball game data using the `cbbpy` library.
- Preprocessing the data for model training.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models using `scikit-learn`.
- Generating predictions for upcoming games.
- Exporting predictions to [NCAA_Game_Predictions.csv](NCAA_Game_Predictions.csv).
- Updating the README file with the latest model performance and high confidence predictions.

## Libraries Used

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- [cbbpy](https://pypi.org/project/cbbpy/): A Python library for scraping NCAA basketball data.
